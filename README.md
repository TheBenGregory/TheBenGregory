I am a full-stack developer enrolled in Nashville Software School Cohort #50 and have been building my skills in JavaScript, React, and HTML. I am currently learning Python and will soon move into Django. I live in Middle TN and enjoy being outdoors, hiking, and exploring national parks.

I have long been interested in computers and coding and over the years have built a handful of webpages for myself. In my free time I tinker with my 3d printer work on personal dev projects.
